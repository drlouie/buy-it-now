### Paypal Sales Monitoring

### Multiple Payment Processsor Integration Example (Using Google Checkout)

Considering this plugin hasn't been updated in over 6 years, and its being released as open-source, it pays to mention the fact that multiple payment processor integration isn't only possible, its already written into the plugin. Use the integrated Google Checkout programming as an example. Much like I stated, this plugin hasn't been updated in 6+ years, never really going back in to integrate Square, Stripe, Apple Pay or any other payment processors nor to remove Google Checkout.
